        <h1>History of SMTP</h1>
        <p>SMTP is a relatively simple, text-based protocol, in which a mail sender communicates with a mail receiver by issuing simple command strings and supplying necessary data over a reliable ordered data stream channel, typically Transmission Control
        Protocol (TCP) connection. When we send an e-mail message from our computer to another computer, it will go trough many different servers before it actually reaches our recipient's computer. The first stop for our e-mail message is an SMTP e-mail
        server. This server communicates directly with our computer using a protocol named SMTP. It is the de facto standard for e-mail transmission from clients to mail servers via the Internet. SMTP is an old protocol and was used already in the 1980s
        to transfer messages between computers. Its objective is to transfer mail reliably and efficiently SMTP is the IETF's Standard Number 10, or STD0010 Standard e-mail formats are also closely related to the SMTP standard</p>
